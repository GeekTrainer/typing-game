# Event-Driven Programming - Build a Typing Game

### Introduction

Typing is one of the most underrated skills of the developer. The ability to quickly transfer thoughts from your head to your editor allows creativity to flow freely. One of the best ways to learn is to play a game! So, let's build a typing game!

You're going to use the JavaScript, HTML and CSS skills you have to create a typing game. The game will present the player with a random quote (we're using [Sherlock Holmes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes) quotes) and time how long the player takes to type it out accurately.

As the user types, the current word will be highlighted on the quote. When the user completes the word (indicated by clicking the space bar) it will disappear from the textbox and the next word will be highlighted. Upon correct completion of the quote, the game will display the elapsed time.
